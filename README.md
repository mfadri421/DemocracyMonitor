A repository for a program that maps changes in laws, Supreme Court decisions, and executive orders as they relate to voting rights, reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, criminal justice reform, environmental protections, and disabilties rights.
An MCA is used to plot the nodes of the network, and edges show how one event influences another, and also whether an expansion or contraction of rights occured in the transition from one event to another.
